# Hello, I'm Caden 👋

### Software Engineer, Systems, ML, and AI Enthusiast

## About Me
I'm a passionate software engineer studying Computer Science at University of Pittsburgh, with experience building real-world applications through internships at Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute (where I published a blog post) and Bank of New York.

I won first place at SteelHacks XI and love exploring AI and modern web applications. This dashboard monitors all my deployed applications in real-time.

## Projects

### GPT-Style Encoder & Inference Engine | C, AI/ML, Linear Algebra
- Engineered a transformer-based encoder from scratch in C, capable of training on thousands of sentences.
- Implemented a custom inference engine for next-word predictions, enabling practical low-level ML without external libraries.

### Nintendo Entertainment System Emulator | Rust
- Achieved 100% instruction coverage by implementing all 151 official and 105 unofficial opcodes	 of the MOS 6502 CPU.
- Established seamless cross-platform compatibility by leveraging Rust’s portability to support Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

### Compiler for Subset of Java Programming Language | C, C++, Yacc, Bison, Flex
- Developed a compiler capable of parsing and executing a subset of Java, passing 100% of custom test cases.
- Designed lexical and syntax analyzers with Flex and Bison, reducing parsing errors by 90% compared to baseline.

### TCP Implementation in C | C, Wireshark
- Built a TCP protocol implementation in C, achieving reliable data transfer with <2% packet loss in simulated networks.
- Validated functionality with integration tests across multiple OS environments, ensuring compliance with TCP standards.

### TriviaTok.us | React.js, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB
- Launched a social media web application utilizing Google’s Gemini API to create thousands of questions on demand.
- Architected a robust, scalable backend RESTful API using Express.js and MongoDB, resulting in 100% data accessibility.
